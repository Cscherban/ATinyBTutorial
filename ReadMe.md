Just somthing I wish someone had made when I start trying to  use this Library

Enclosed are a Bunch of extremely simple examples for the tinyB library

Eventually this should contain examples demonstrating the capabillities of each class in the Library.
Feel free to add if you have any cool things

Intel Library Documentation: 

TinyB installation instructions: 
To get the necessary Jar Files, you can go the section 3 of the following link:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/java-for-iot-reference

I recommend reading the guide in depth at least once or twice
